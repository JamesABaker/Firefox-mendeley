# About
Calls the Mendeley importer (maintained by [Mendeley](http://blog.mendeley.com/research-tutorials/mendeleys-one-click-web-importer/)) to cite the current page. This is primarily for academic web pages that are often behind paywalls. A good open access journal article to test is [PLoS](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002240).

The opened dialogue is called from Mendeley directly, so works anywhere the bookmark would.
